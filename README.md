Embed resources into code
=========================

This is an Arduino IDE example project for embedding text resources into the binary automatically.
It makes the contents of all `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files from the `data/` directory available in the code. E.g. `data/page1.html` is embedded as `page1_html`.
